# climate-stripes-sofia
# 🌍 Climate Stripes in Sofia, Bulgaria

This Jupyter Notebook visualizes over 80 years of scaled temperature anomalies using climate stripes, based on open Copernicus climate data. The notebook is designed as an interdisciplinary educational resource combining geography, climate science, statistics, informatics and data visualization in Python.
